[7C[37mWelcome to the world of [36mStuga[37m! Stuga is a classic, Swedish text
[7Cadventure game originally released in 1978. The first version of
[7Cthe game was written in BASIC on Oden, a DEC-10 mainframe computer
[7Cat QZ in Stockholm, Sweden. The game was later released for PC
[7Cwith the name changed to Stugan.

[7C[0mIn summer 2019 I found out that one of the original authors,
[7CKimmo Eriksson, had found the original source code and released
[7Cit on his homepage ([1;34mhttps://www.kimmoeriksson.se[0m). Unfortunately,
[7CI could not find an interpreter compatible with the specific
[7CBASIC dialect the game was written in, so I set out to write an
[7Can interpreter in JavaScript with enough functionality to run
[7Cthe game (how hard can it be?!).

[7CSeveral months later, the interpreter is finally complete enough
[7Cto run most of the game. I've not yet managed to play the whole
[7Cgame through, so there might be catastrophic incompatibilities
[7Clater in the game!

[7CI've made minimal changes to the game source code. It's more or
[7Cless only fixing what invalid line breaks, text encodings and
[7Cvery few functions that I've still not implemented in the inter-
[7Cpreter. These functions are mostly related to saving game state
[7Cwhich unfortunately is not working anyway.

[7C│ [37mPlease use ALL CAPS when playing the game![15C[31m│

[7C│ [0mAll parts of the game work with capital letters, but[5C[1;31m│
[7C│ [0monly some parts (notably while being outdoors) work with [1;31m│
[7C│ [0mlower case. So to be safe, use caps for the entire game. [1;31m│

[7C[37mYou are now in the BASIC interpreter. The game has already
[7Cbeen loaded, so go ahead and type [33mRUN [37mto start the game!

[7CYou can also print the game code by typing [33mLIST[37m. You can
[7Ceven clear the memory ([33mNEW[37m) and write your own game in BASIC!
